I am not gonna make a recipe list, instead I am going to say the syntax of recorirdan's all series and how to read them in an understandable order
as one of my friend(who told me about the book)started from the 3rd path and then 2 and the 4 and the 1 and then 5. and anothe first read the second series and then gone with the first series
yeah I am the only in my frien group to read all the parts in order
So here it is:-
PERCY JAKSON SERIES
HROES OF OLYMPUS SERIES
TRAILS OF APOLLO SERIES
MAGNUS CHASE SERIES(I'M HERE)
KANE CHRONICALS SERIES
